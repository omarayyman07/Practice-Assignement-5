# Practice Assignment 5 - CSEN202

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for **Practice Assignment 5** of the **CSEN202** course. The assignment includes various programming tasks that reinforce fundamental concepts in Java, such as recursion, string manipulation, switch statements, and algorithm implementation.

## Contents
- `ZAlgorithm.java` - A Java program that implements the Z-Algorithm for pattern matching.
- `Factorial.java` - A recursive implementation of the factorial function.
- `PalindromeChecker.java` - A program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
- `PrimeChecker.java` - A program to determine if a given number is prime.
- `PhoneNumberTranslator.java` - A program that translates phone numbers containing letters into numerical format based on the standard phone keypad mapping.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Practice-Assignment-5.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Practice-Assignment-5
   ```
3. Compile and run any Java file:
   ```sh
   javac FileName.java
   java FileName
   ```
   Replace `FileName` with the name of the Java file you wish to run.
